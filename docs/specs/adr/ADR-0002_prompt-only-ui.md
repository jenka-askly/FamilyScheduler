# ADR-0002: Prompt-Only UI

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-18

## Context

The product vision requires minimal UI complexity and conversational control flow.

## Decision

UI will contain only:

- transcript output area
- single prompt input

No calendar/list/form editing interfaces will be added.

## Consequences

- Reduced frontend complexity.
- Higher importance of precise text summaries and clear confirmation prompts.
