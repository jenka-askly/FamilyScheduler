### Approach

- Created target monorepo directory/file structure.
- Authored required specification documents and ADRs.
- Added GitHub workflow/template scaffolds.
- Added baseline tooling/environment files.
- Added continuity docs (`PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `CODEX_LOG.md`).

### Commands run + outcomes

- `mkdir -p ...` ✅ created scaffold directories.
- Multiple `cat > <file>` commands ✅ wrote required scaffold/config/spec files.
- `git status --short` (to verify pending changes) ✅ expected new files.

### Follow-ups

- Implement API and web runtime code per spec.
- Add executable scripts and real CI lint/typecheck/test commands.
- Add package manifests and lockfile.

## 2026-02-18 UTC (follow-up)

### Objective

Enable meaningful local verification in scaffold-only state by adding a safe root `package.json` and wiring CI to run pnpm commands.

### Approach

- Added minimal root `package.json` with placeholder scripts and workspace-safe CI command.
- Updated README with scaffold-stage verification instructions.
- Updated project status checklist and recorded this PR's changes.
- Updated CI workflow to run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run ci`.
- Added `.vs/` to `.gitignore` for editor hygiene.

### Files changed

- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.gitignore`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `pnpm -v` ⚠️ failed in this environment because Corepack could not download pnpm (`Proxy response (403)`).
- `pnpm install` ⚠️ blocked by the same Corepack/network issue in this environment.
- `pnpm run ci` ⚠️ blocked by the same Corepack/network issue in this environment.
- `git status --short` ✅ only expected repository edits.

### Follow-ups

- Add real package manifests in `apps/web`, `api`, and `packages/shared`.
- Replace placeholder lint/typecheck/test scripts with executable project checks.

## 2026-02-18 UTC (deploy workflow non-blocking update)

### Objective

Prevent CI/deploy failures when `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` is not configured while preserving the deploy workflow for future use.

### Approach

- Updated SWA deploy action inputs to skip deployment when required secrets are missing.
- Changed `output_location` from `dist` to `.` to match current scaffold state (no build output yet).
- Updated continuity documentation in `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to record non-blocking deploy behavior.

### Files changed

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `python - <<'PY' ...` ✅ updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` deployment checklist and recent update section.
- `git diff -- .github/workflows/deploy.yml PROJECT_STATUS.md CODEX_LOG.md` ✅ verified targeted minimal diff.

### Follow-ups

- Configure `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` in repository secrets to enable actual deployments.
- Replace `output_location: .` with real build output path once `apps/web` implementation exists.

## 2026-02-18 UTC (pnpm CI version alignment)

### Objective

Fix CI pnpm setup so GitHub Actions uses the pnpm version declared in `package.json` (`packageManager`) and avoids version conflicts.

### Approach

- Removed explicit `version: 10` from `pnpm/action-setup@v4` in CI.
- Kept `packageManager: pnpm@10.30.0` unchanged in `package.json`.
- Performed targeted checks to confirm workflow and package manager alignment.

### Files changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `sed -n '1,220p' .github/workflows/ci.yml && cat package.json` ✅ verified current setup and package manager declaration.
- `git diff -- .github/workflows/ci.yml` ✅ confirmed only pnpm version pin removal.

### Follow-ups

- Verify on next GitHub Actions run that pnpm installs at `10.30.0` without "Multiple versions" errors.

## 2026-02-18 20:21 UTC (chunk 1 local runnable prompt UI + stub chat API)

### Objective

Implement the first runnable milestone: local prompt-only UI + stub `POST /api/chat` echo endpoint, with workspace/tooling/docs/CI updates.

### Approach

- Added workspace package manifests and TypeScript configs for `apps/web`, `api`, and `packages/shared`.
- Implemented Azure Functions v4 HTTP trigger for `/api/chat` with request validation and deterministic echo reply.
- Implemented Vite + React prompt-only UI with transcript and single input submit flow.
- Added Vite dev proxy for `/api` to `http://localhost:7071`.
- Updated root scripts for `dev`, `dev:web`, `dev:api`, and workspace-oriented `ci` checks.
- Updated runbook and project status to reflect runnable local workflow and next milestones.
- Updated CI workflow to run install and `pnpm -r --if-present build`.

### Files changed

- `package.json`
- `packages/shared/package.json`
- `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`
- `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts`

- `apps/web/README.md`
- `docs/runbook.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `pnpm install` ⚠️ failed in this environment due to Corepack/proxy restriction downloading pnpm (`Proxy response (403)`).
- `func --version` ⚠️ failed because Azure Functions Core Tools is not installed in this environment (`command not found: func`).
- `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'` ✅ used to timestamp this log entry.

### Follow-ups

- Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, and API/web smoke tests in an environment with registry access and Functions Core Tools.
- Add deterministic help/list/confirm protocol + auth in next PR.

## 2026-02-18 20:32 UTC (docs continuity: lockfile + approve-builds)

### Objective

Document lockfile/caching continuity and local `pnpm approve-builds` guidance after recent GitHub and local setup changes.

### Approach

- Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with explicit local dev and CI checklist items.
- Added a recent changes section capturing both lockfile purpose and esbuild approval step.
- Updated runbook local setup with the `Ignored build scripts: esbuild` remediation.

### Files changed

- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `docs/runbook.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `python - <<'PY' ...` ✅ inserted local setup note in `docs/runbook.md`.
- `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'` ✅ captured log timestamp.
- `git diff -- PROJECT_STATUS.md docs/runbook.md CODEX_LOG.md` ✅ verified targeted documentation-only changes.

### Follow-ups

- Confirm next CI run uses committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `setup-node` pnpm cache without lockfile errors.

## 2026-02-18 20:39 UTC (chunk 2 proposal + confirm protocol)

### Objective

Implement deterministic in-memory confirmation protocol for the stub chat API and update the web client to handle new response kinds.

### Approach

- Updated `POST /api/chat` classification to deterministic `mutation` / `confirm` / `query` handling.
- Added module-level in-memory `pendingProposal` with proposal creation and confirm/apply semantics.
- Updated web transcript handling to accept `reply`, `proposal`, and `applied` response kinds.
- Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to reflect current behavior and revised next milestones.

### Files changed

- `api/src/functions/chat.ts`
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `pnpm -r --if-present build` ⚠️ failed in this environment because Corepack could not download pnpm (`Proxy response (403)`).
- `pnpm -r --if-present test` ⚠️ failed in this environment for the same Corepack/network reason.
- `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'` ✅ captured log timestamp.

### Follow-ups

- Add persistent proposal/state storage and operation codes.
- Add structured action schema to replace prefix-based classification.

## 2026-02-18 20:43 UTC (api build fix: add Node type definitions)

### Objective

Fix workspace build failure `TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'node'` in the API package.

### Approach

- Added `@types/node` to `api` `devDependencies`.
- Kept `api/tsconfig.json` `types: ["node"]` unchanged so the type reference resolves.
- Attempted to run root dependency install and workspace build verification.
- Updated continuity docs with this build-fix status.

### Files changed

- `api/package.json`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `pnpm install` ⚠️ failed in this environment because Corepack could not download pnpm (`Proxy response (403)`).
- `pnpm -r --if-present build` ⚠️ not runnable for the same Corepack/network reason (pnpm unavailable).
- `rg -n "@types/node|types": \[\"node\"\]" api/package.json api/tsconfig.json` ✅ confirmed package/tsconfig wiring.
- `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'` ✅ captured log timestamp.

### Follow-ups

- Re-run `pnpm install` and `pnpm -r --if-present build` in CI or a network-enabled local environment to regenerate/confirm `pnpm-lock.yaml` and verify no `TS2688` remains.

## 2026-02-18 21:01 UTC (fix build: workspace TypeScript dependency)

### Objective

Fix workspace builds where `tsc` is not found by adding TypeScript at the workspace root and updating continuity docs.

### Approach

- Added root `devDependencies.typescript` with specifier `^5.5.0` in `package.json`.
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` root importer to include workspace-root `typescript` dependency mapping.
- Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` recent changes to document the workspace TypeScript dependency addition for local/CI builds.
- Attempted dependency install and workspace build verification.

### Files changed

- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `CODEX_LOG.md`

### Commands run + outcomes

- `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` ⚠️ failed in this environment because Corepack could not download pnpm (`Proxy response (403)`).
- `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC'` ✅ captured log timestamp.

### Follow-ups

- Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` in a network-enabled environment to fully regenerate lockfile metadata if needed.
- Run `pnpm -r --if-present build` to confirm `tsc` resolution across workspaces in local/CI.
