# PROJECT_STATUS

## Current milestone

Local runnable baseline implemented with Azure Functions discovery fixed for local chat endpoint and TypeScript output aligned to the Functions entrypoint `dist/index.js`.

## What works now

- Fixed Azure Functions v4 discovery by registering HTTP trigger from `api/src/index.ts` (compiled to `api/dist/index.js`).
- Local `/api/chat` route reachable via Functions host (`POST http://localhost:7071/api/chat`) with JSON response.
- Tracked `api/local.settings.example.json`; local copy workflow documented in runbook.
- Confirmation protocol implemented (in-memory only).
- In-memory appointment state in API (`appointments[]`) with runtime-stable generated codes (`APPT-1`, `APPT-2`, ...).
- `list appointments` command returns one appointment per line (`APPT-n — <title>`).
- `show APPT-n` command returns appointment details or a not-found message.
- Mutation-like commands require explicit `confirm` before apply.
- No persistence yet for pending proposals.
- Monorepo is runnable locally with `pnpm dev`.
- Prompt-only web UI is implemented at `apps/web`:
  - transcript area
  - single prompt input
  - Enter submits prompt
  - initial hint: `Type 'help' for examples.`
- Stub Azure Functions API endpoint is implemented at `POST /api/chat` with deterministic command handling:
  - request `{ "message": "..." }`
  - queries return `{ "kind":"reply", "assistantText":"You asked: <message>" }`
  - mutation-like commands return `{ "kind":"proposal", ... }` and require explicit `confirm`
  - `confirm` applies the pending proposal and returns `{ "kind":"applied", ... }`
  - validation error for missing/empty message.
- Shared package has initial placeholder type (`Person`) and builds.
- CI installs dependencies and runs workspace build checks with `pnpm -r --if-present build`.

## How to run locally

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Node.js 20+
   - pnpm 10+
   - Azure Functions Core Tools v4
2. Run:
   - `pnpm install`
   - `cp api/local.settings.example.json api/local.settings.json`
   - `pnpm dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` and submit a prompt.

## Local dev checklist

- `pnpm install` generates/uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- If pnpm warns about ignored build scripts, run `pnpm approve-builds` and select `esbuild`.

## CI checklist

- CI requires `pnpm-lock.yaml` to be present (or dependency caching disabled); current state: lockfile is committed.

## Recent changes

- 2026-02-18: Added API clean-build script (`pnpm -C api run clean`) and wired `api` build to clean `dist/` before compilation so stale artifacts cannot mask the Functions entrypoint (`dist/index.js`) path.
- 2026-02-18: Fixed Azure Functions entrypoint mismatch by setting `api/tsconfig.json` `rootDir` to `src` (with `outDir` `dist`) so builds emit `api/dist/index.js` and `api/dist/functions/chat.js`; updated runbook troubleshooting for `entry point dist/index.js does not exist` and confirmed `/api/chat` is reachable locally.
- 2026-02-18: Fixed local Azure Functions runtime discovery by moving v4 trigger registration to `api/src/index.ts`, added tracked `api/local.settings.example.json`, and updated runbook for `local.settings.json` copy so local `POST /api/chat` no longer 404s.
- 2026-02-18: Added in-memory appointment mutation/query support in API (`add appt <title>`, `confirm`, `list appointments`, `show APPT-n`) with runtime-generated human-readable appointment codes and post-apply snapshot output.
- 2026-02-18: Added workspace-root `typescript` devDependency (`^5.5.0`) so workspace `tsc` invocations resolve during local/CI builds.
- 2026-02-18: Fixed API TypeScript build configuration by adding `@types/node` to `api` devDependencies to resolve `TS2688` (Cannot find type definition file for `node`).
- 2026-02-18: Added `pnpm-lock.yaml` to the repository so GitHub Actions (`setup-node` cache: pnpm) can run without failing.
- 2026-02-18: Local dev note: run `pnpm approve-builds` and select `esbuild` to avoid pnpm warning and allow the Vite/esbuild toolchain to function.

## Known limitations

- No authentication/passkey yet.
- No persistence yet (proposal confirmation is in-memory only).
- No storage integration (local/blob) yet.
- No OpenAI integration yet.

## Next steps

1. Replace naive parsing with a structured action schema.
2. Add delete + update appointment flows with confirmation protocol.
3. Add availability model for assignment/scheduling decisions.

## Continuity rule
